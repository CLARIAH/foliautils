.SH NAME
FoLiA-correct - correct FoLiA files using correction candidates generated by
.B TICCL-rank

.SH SYNOPSIS
FoLiA-correct [options] FILE

FoLiA-correct [options] DIR

.SH DESCRIPTION

When a DIR is provided,
.B FoLiA-correct
will process all FoLiA xml files in DIR (probably recursing into deeper
directories) and create corrected variants of each file.
The name of the output file will have '.ticcl' added before the original
extension. (e.g. data.folia.xml will be corrected to data.folia.ticcl.xml)

When a FILE is provided,
.B FoLiA-correct
will process that file and store its result in the directory where FILE is
found.

It will rewrite the original OCR paragraph on the basis of the best-first ranked correction candidates and add a specified number of ranked correction suggestion elements.
