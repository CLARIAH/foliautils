.SH NAME
FoLiA-correct - correct FoLiA files using correction candidates generated by
.B TICCL-rank
or postprocessed by
.B TICCL-chain
or

.SH SYNOPSIS
FoLiA-correct [options] FILE

FoLiA-correct [options] DIR

.SH DESCRIPTION

When a DIR is provided,
.B FoLiA-correct
will process all FoLiA xml files in DIR (recursing into deeper directories
when -R is provided) and create corrected variants of each file.
The name of the output file will have '.ticcl' added before the original
extension. (e.g. data.folia.xml will be corrected to data.folia.ticcl.xml)

When a FILE is provided,
.B FoLiA-correct
will process that file and store its result in the directory where FILE is
found.

It will rewrite the original OCR paragraph on the basis of the best-first ranked correction candidates and add a specified number of ranked correction suggestion elements.
